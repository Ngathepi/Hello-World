Hi, my name is Nga Phan

I don't know coding. Now I am interested in data science, machine learning and articificial intelligent. 

I don't know if my interest last long. But at least should have some serious practice and research about it first.

Today I learned about branches on GitHub. So a file can have multiple branches created/edit by different people. Until the project on a branch done, it can merge with the master/main file. 
And I don't need to install Git on my computer. GitHub is enough.
